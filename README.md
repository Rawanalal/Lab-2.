This task uses (Iris Species) dataset from the open source Kaggle to classify different types of flowers. The problem is a classification problem using supervised machine learning where the target variable is the type of flower (species). The model is expected to predict the species of a flower by referring to physical characteristics such as length, width, sepal and petal measurements to correlate it to the correct flower spices and predict an accurate answer based on these features.
